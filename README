This is *not* a BSP (board support package). I did not implement all drivers, only the ones I needed. I used armtastic, which is also available on Github, and Rowley's BSP. Some files are missing here since they are part of a project I would rather not open for now. However, the logic implemented here is important since it is my interpretation of the spec sheets, along with the workarounds I had to implement for spec sheet/hardware bugs. Enjoy!
